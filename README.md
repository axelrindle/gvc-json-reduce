# GVC-Json-Reduce
A very small side-project for [github-version-checker](https://github.com/axelrindle/github-version-checker)
which drastically reduces the size of the returned JSON by the **Github Rest API (v3)**. It forwards
the given request url and transforms it so only the relevant information is returned.
